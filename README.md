# Snakes and Ladders AI

This project implements an AI for the classic game "Snakes and Ladders" using the Minimax algorithm. The AI is designed to make optimal moves considering the presence of snakes and ladders on the board.

## Features

1. **Game Representation**:
   - Represents the game state including the board layout, player positions, and relevant game rules.

2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Identifies and generates all possible moves that the AI player can make in a given game state. This involves simulating dice rolls and determining the resulting positions.

3. **Check for Snakes and Ladders**:
   - Implements a function to check if a new position after a move involves encountering a snake or climbing a ladder. Adjusts the position accordingly.

4. **Minimax Algorithm**:
   - Applies the Minimax algorithm to create a decision tree representing possible moves and outcomes.
   - Defines an evaluation function to assign a score to terminal game states, considering factors such as the distance to the goal and the presence of snakes or ladders.

5. **Recursive Tree Exploration**:
   - Recursively explores the decision tree, evaluating each possible move and backtracking the scores to find the optimal move for the AI player.

6. **Decision Making**:
   - At the root of the decision tree, selects the move that leads to the highest score, indicating the most favorable outcome for the AI player.

7. **Integration with Game Loop**:
   - Integrates the AI decision-making process into the overall game loop, allowing the AI to make moves in response to the user's actions.

## Explanation

### Game State
The game state includes the positions of both players, the layout of the board, and any additional relevant information. This is crucial for assessing the impact of each move.

### Possible Moves
Generates all possible moves based on the current game state, simulating the rolling of the dice and updating player positions accordingly.

### Check for Snakes and Ladders
Ensures that the AI considers the presence of snakes and ladders, adjusting the position if a move leads to encountering one.

### Minimax Algorithm
The Minimax algorithm is used to explore the decision tree, evaluating each possible move and determining the optimal strategy for the AI player.

### Recursive Tree Exploration
The algorithm recursively explores the decision tree, assigning scores to terminal states and backtracking these scores to the root of the tree.

### Decision Making
The AI selects the move at the root of the decision tree that maximizes its chances of winning, considering the scores assigned during the tree exploration.

### Integration with Game Loop
The AI's decision-making process is seamlessly integrated into the game loop, allowing the AI to respond to the user's actions and make strategic moves throughout the game.

## How to Run

1. **Setup**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Install necessary dependencies (if any). For example, you might use `pip` to install required packages:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Running the Game**:
   - Execute the main game script to start the game:
     ```sh
     python main.py
     ```

4. **Gameplay**:
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. The AI will make its moves automatically based on the implemented strategy.
